How vulnerable is Pakistan's Telecommunication infrastructure to Natural Disasters?
Rationale: This research aims to analyse how floods and other natural disasters affect mobile connectivity and internet services in Pakistan, identifying regions at higher risk of service disruption. The infrastructure there can be more safely deployed so they can withstand the disasters. Communication during disasters is necessary for efficient evacuation and transit. We can look at PTA data at times surrounding floods to look at how telecommunication infrastructure handled the impact of floods. Atlas RIS data which shows the BGP pathways can also be used to see how many paths were affected during the floods. Will need to parse data to collect data from Pakistan from the RIS data. We can analyse hope to predict how much communication will be lost in future incidents.
